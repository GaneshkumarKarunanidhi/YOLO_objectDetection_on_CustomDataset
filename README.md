#Custom.yaml formation
  The main thing for the YOLO Custom object detection is custom.yaml formation.It attached the format is given below and also I add the My custom.yaml file in this repository 
 
path: (optinal) 
train: # train folder path 
val:   # val images 
test:  # test images (optional)
nc: 2 #number of classes 
names: ['crop','weed'] # mention the object name 

The main thing in yaml file variable after colan(:) a space must be provided before the values.If you are correctly mention the path ,nc and names but forget the space it will show the error.


#Output 
   The all the output will be saved same path under the runs/detect/train.
   prediction result also saved in the same path in runs/detect/predict
   The Predict folder object detected images.
